# Torrent Adder Safari Extension

This is a simple Safari extension, that allows you to remotely add a torrent to a backend. Currently, the only backend available is Transmission WebUI, but it should be fairly simple to add more.

You can find out more about the making of it [here](http://blog.jetboystudio.com/articles/safari-extension/)

You can get a ready-for-install plugin [here](https://github.com/konsumer/torrentadder/releases/download/v1.0.0/TorrentAdder.safariextz).
